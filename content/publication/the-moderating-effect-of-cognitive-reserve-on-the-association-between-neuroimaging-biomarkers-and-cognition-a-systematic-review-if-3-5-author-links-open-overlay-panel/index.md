  This systematic review aims to investigate the moderating effects of cognitive
  reserve (CR) on the relationships between cognitive function and multimodal
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-signatured brain changes, measured by positron
  emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and
  functional MRI (fMRI). Through a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and
  Web of Science, we identified 55 eligible studies examining the moderating
  effect of CR on the relationship between neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive
  outcomes. CR measurements include sociobehavioral proxies (e.g., education,
  leisure activities), residual approaches, and functional imaging approaches.
  Findings were mixed. Of the fifty-five studies, 41 studies reported a
  protective effect of CR, suggesting its buffering effect against cognitive
  decline or AD progression during ageing. However, eleven studies reported no
  interaction between CR and neuroimaging biomarkers. Six studies suggested a
  detrimental effect of CR in the middle-to-late stages of the disease [e.g.,
  mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD] (three studies reported both
  protective and detrimental effects). The discrepancies may reflect that the
  influence of CR on the association between neuroimaging biomarkers and
  cognitive function depends on disease stage. In early stages, it exhibits
  protective effects, but as pathology accumulates, it may accelerate cognitive
  decline. This review revealed CR has heterogeneous effects on AD progression.
  We preliminarily identified a “critical point” for CR within the continuum
  between cognitively unimpaired (CU) and MCI, although its precise pathological
  determinants require further clarification. Establishing standardized CR
  metrics and conducting longitudinal biomarker-integrated studies are critical
  to pinpoint optimal intervention windows for maximizing CR’s protective
  effects.

summary: |-
  CR buffers early AD cognitive impact from neuroimaging biomarkers.
  High CR may lead to sharper cognitive decline in later AD stages.
  CR’s “critical point” may lie between CU and MCI stages.
